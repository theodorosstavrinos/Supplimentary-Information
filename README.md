The project investigates the effects of an FG-loop mutation (F174A) on substrate binding and catalysis of the cytochrome P450 peroxygenase OleTSa from Staphylococcus aureus. Included are detailed experimental protocols (From Methods and Materials), UV/Vis spectroscopy data, DNA sequencing chromatograms verifying site-directed mutagenesis, computationally derived homology models of wild-type and mutant OleTSa proteins with the amino acid sequences used to generate them.
